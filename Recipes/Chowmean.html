    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chow mein is a popular Chinese dish characterized by stir-fried noodles, typically made from wheat flour,
     combined with a variety of vegetables, meat, or seafood. The noodles are stir-fried in a wok to achieve a 
     slightly crispy texture while maintaining a tender interior. Commonly featured ingredients include cabbage, 
     carrots, onions, bell peppers, and bean sprouts, along with options like chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu. 
     Flavorful sauces such as soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil are used to season the dish, offering a balance
